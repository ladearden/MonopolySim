# MonopolySim
The game has 2 players starting with $1500 each and tries to follow the real rules of Monopoly (ie $200 for passing Go) as closely as possible.
The final output is shown in a results text file and shows each dice roll along with the final stats of each player (ie remaining money, properties owned).
The game is stopped after 2 full trips around the board and uses the US board layout.
The following have not been implemented: houses/hotels, chance/community chest, goto jail.
